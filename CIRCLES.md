HIGH-LEVEL OVERVIEW:

CIRCLES IN A DECENTRALIZED SOCIAL PLATFORM WHERE USERS CAN INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER USING WIRELESS MESH PROTOCOLS VIA THE APP.THIS ESSENTIALLY CREATES A DISTRIBUTED PLATFORM ON WHICH THE USERS CAN INTERACT, SHARE AND STORE INFORMATION WITH MINIMAL USE OF THE INTERNET.



VISION:

THE APP ALLOWS USERS TO DEFINE THE USERBASE THE APP THAT THE USER WANTS TO INTERACT WITH, FOR EXAMPLE IF THE USER WANTS TO ONLY COMMUNICATE WITH THE PEOPLE IN HIS/HER UNIVERSITY CIRCLE ALLOW THE USER TO DO SO BY DYNAMICALLY FORMING A NETWORK OF PEOPLE BASED ON THE PROXIMITY OF THE USER THIS IS NOT POSSIBLE ON A CENTRALISED PLATFORM EG.FACEBOOK AS IT RQUIRES ADDITIONAL DATA ABOUT THE INDIVISUALS SUCH AS THEIR UNIVERSITY NAME/LOCATION ACCESS.



THE DECENTRALIZED NATURE OF THE APP ALSO ALLOWS THE INDIVIDUAL TO SET PRIVACY/ANONYMITY STANDARDS/ THE USER CAN ELECT COMPLETELY TO HIDE HIS/HER IDENTITY OF SHOW THE SAME TO SELCT PEOPLE BASE ON LOCATION/INTEREST/NO OF COMMON CONNECTED USERS ETC.THIS ALSO ALLOWS ONLY VERFIFIED USERS TO JOIN THE GORUP DUE TO THE VERIFIABLE NATURE OF THEIR IDENTITY.



BENEFITS:

DATA PRIVACY:THE DECENTRALIZED NATURE OF TH APP ENSURES THAT NOT ALL DATA IS STORED OR PROCESSED AT A CENTRALIZED SERVER, THE VARIOUS NODES/DEVICES RUNNING THE APP/PROTOCOL ON THE PLATFORM.

NO SINGLE POINT OF FAILURE:EACH DEVICE RUNNING THE APP ACTS AS AN ACCESS POINT THUS THERE EXISTS INCREASED REDUNDANCY AND LOWER DOWNTIME

REDUCED DEPENDENCY ON THE INTERNET:

OPEN NATURE/MINIMAL MODERATION:THE DECENTRALIZED NATURE OF THE APP ELIMINATES ANY RESTRICTION ON AN INDIVIDUAL TO JOIN AND LIMITS CENSORSHIP

MODULAR NATURE:THE PLATFORM CAN BE LEVERAGES BY THE INDIVIDUAL TO PERFORM A HOST OF FUNCTIONS SUCH AS TAKING POOLS/SHARING INFORMATION IN A SMALL SET OF PEOPLE/STORING DATA ON THE APP/NETWORK,RUN OTHER SUB APPLICATIONS WITHIN TH APP WHICH PEOPLE CAN THUS USE.

CREATION OF "LOCAL" COMMUNITIES: DECENTRALIZED NATURE OF THE APP ALLOWS THE USER OF THE APP TO PROPAGATE INFORMATION LOCALLY TO A FIXED RADIUS AROUND THE USER.

CREATION OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNITIES(USER LAYERS):THE APP WOULD FACILITATE THE FORMATION OF A "LAYER"- PLACES ON THE NETWORK WITH SPECIFIC PURPOSES; EG:DISSING PUBLICATIONS IN IEEE JOURNALS(INFORMATION LAYER),SECURLY STORING DATA PEROSNAL ON THE NETWORK(STORAGE LAYER),RENDERRING VIDEOS(COMPUTE LAYER), TRANSATIONAL LAYER.

DYNAMIC USER-BASE:UNLIKE A CENTRALIZED APPLICATION/PLATFORM CIRCLES GIVES THE USERS THE ABILITY TO FORM DYNAMIC NETWORKS BASED ON THEIR PROXIMITY,INTERESTS/GOLS,ORGANIZATION ETC.

DECENTRALIZED ID:THE USERS ON THE PLATFORM CAN LINK THEIR ACCOUNTS TO CIRCLE AS THE DATA IS NOT STORED ON ANY CENTRALIZED SERVER AND THIS CAN THUS BE VERIFIED AND USED FOR ATHENTICATION OF THE IDETITY OF THE USER/INDIVISUAL.
